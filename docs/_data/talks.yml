    In this talk, I discussed various tools developed for and by the ComSoC community.
    I began by highlighting recent developments in PrefLib. Subsequently, I provided an overview
    of the general ComSoC ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on newly created tools. Finally,
    I proposed a general discussion on organizing and valorizing such tools.

- title: "Fairness in Participatory Budgeting via Equality of Resources"
  event: "CMSS Summer Workshop"
  date: "Dec. 19, 2022"
  description: >
    We introduce a family of normative principles to assess fairness in the context of 
    participatory budgeting. These principles are based on the fundamental idea that budget
    allocations should be fair in terms of the resources invested into meeting the wishes of
    individual voters. This is in contrast to earlier proposals that are based on specific 
    assumptions regarding the satisfaction of voters with a given budget allocation. We analyze 
    these new principles in axiomatic, algorithmic, and experimental terms.

  event: "Oxford Local Seminar"
  date: "Nov. 17, 2022"
  description: >
    This is a longer version of the talk on the paper with the same name that was already
    presented at IJCAI 2022. We study settings in which agents with incomplete preferences 
    need to make a collective decision. We focus on a process of majority dynamics where 
    issues are addressed one at a time and undecided agents follow the opinion of the majority.
    We assess the effects of this process on various consensus notions—such as the Condorcet 
    winner—and show that in the worst case, myopic adherence to the majority damages existing
    consensus; yet, simulation experiments indicate that the damage is often mild. We also
    examine scenarios where the chair of the decision process can control the existence
    (or the identity) of consensus, by determining the order in which the issues are discussed.

- title: "Fair Position Assignment"
  event: "2022 SSCW Meeting - Computational and Topological Social Choice Workshop"
  date: "June 22, 2022"
  description: >
    We study a model for fair division in which agents, aside from getting allocated a 
    bundle of items (that can include both goods and chores), are also to be assigned a
    position on a social graph. We focus on the local variant of natural fairness criteria:
    local envy-freeness, local envy-freeness up to one item and local proportionality. For
    each criterion, we study the computational complexity of the task of producing a fair 
    position assignment and, possibly also an item allocation. Specifically, we focus on how 
    different graph topologies influence the complexity of these problems. In many cases both 
    tasks prove to be intractable for the criteria that we consider. Then, we consider the 
    parameterized complexity of the problem. We show how the problem is equivalent to the known 
    dichotomy conjecture for the parameterized graph embedding problem. Thus, we focus on tree-like 
    graphs, and prove fixed-parameter tractability for all criteria but local proportionality, 
    using a set of parameters that are, under some assumptions, reasonably small.

  event: "Workshop Celebrating Sirin Botan's Defense"
  date: "Nov. 25, 2021"
  description: >
    In this talk I will discuss several recent papers on the topic of participatory budgeting.
    Participatory budgeting is usually studied as an extension of multi-winner voting, where
    selecting a candidate results in paying a cost, and where a budget limit constrains the
    cost of the selected candidates. Although highly relevant for the technical analysis, this
    approach does not fully capture participatory budgeting processes as they happen in real l
    ife. This talk aims at presenting other models for participatory budgeting that more closely
    resemble these real-life processes. We will discuss the idea of a two-stage model where agents
    first propose some projects and then vote over the shortlisted projects. We will also have 
    a look at what changes when the process is repeated over several years. Finally, we will have
    a look at how to include additional constraints on top of the budget limit: quotas over 
    categories of projects, dependencies between the projects, ...

  event: "Science Park Open Dag"
  date: "Oct. 2, 2021"
  description: >
    The buurtbudget, known as participatory budgeting in English, is a democratic process 
    aiming at involving citizens in public spending decisions. In several neighborhoods 
    of Amsterdam, residents already can vote for community-driven projects to be paid for 
    from public funds. However, organizing this process is not straightforward, especially 
    when it comes to making a decision based on the ballots that have been submitted. During
    this talk, we will see why some natural procedures to determine the winning projects
    suffer some drawbacks and how to circumvent those drawbacks.

    In this talk I will give a general overview of the epistemic approach in computational
    social choice. In this body of literature, voting is seen as a mechanism to recover the 
    objectively best outcome for the society, given noisy votes. I will discuss the general 
    framework as well as some selected recent contributions, reviewing the main concepts used 
    in the literature.

  event: "17th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning"
  date: "Sept. 18, 2020"
  description: >
    We introduce a new approach for designing rules for participatory budgeting, the problem of
    deciding on the use of public funds based directly on the views expressed by the citizens
    concerned. The core idea is to embed instances of the participatory budgeting problem into
    judgment aggregation, a powerful general-purpose framework for modelling collective decision
    making. Taking advantage of the possibilities offered by judgment aggregation, we enrich the
    familiar setting of participatory budgeting with additional constraints, namely dependencies 
    between projects and quotas regarding different types of projects. We analyze the rules 
    obtained both in algorithmic and in axiomatic terms.

    Participatory Budgeting is a growing topic in social choice. Introduced in the late 1980s

    literature in the field of Computational Social Choice.

  event: "Computational Social Choice Seminars"
  date: "Nov. 5, 2019"

    In this talk I presented some recent work I have been doing with Haris Aziz. We consider a 
    multiagent resource allocation setting in which an agent's utility may decrease or increase 
    when an item is allocated. We present stronger and relaxed versions of the group envy-freeness 
    concept that are especially suitable for the allocation of indivisible items. Of particular
    interest is a concept called group envy-freeness up to one item (GEF1). We studied which 
    fairness concepts guarantee the existence of a fair allocation under which preference domain. 
    For two natural classes of additive utilities, we designed polynomial-time algorithms to
    compute a GEF1 allocation.
